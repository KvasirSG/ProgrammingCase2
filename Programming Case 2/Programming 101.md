Hey guys, You have have done an amazing job so far. <br>
I have just edited a couple stuff and added in this little guide for you to use.<br>
kind regards,<br>
Felix(TheMasterCoder) -A friend of Kenneth<br>

programming 101:<br>
1. Criteria (What your program shall and shall not do) (Check mark list)<br>
2. Flow Chart (navigation map to how to code your program).<br>
3. list up all the variables, equations and ETC that you are going to need<br>
4. start programming. always make a header in the top of the code. (with Title of the program and the coder(s)).<br>
5. add in comments BEFORE you code (what are the next line(s) of code going to do).<br>
6. write the code.<br>
7 repeat step 5 and 6 till done.<br>
8. test the program from the criteria, does it work yes? okay complete. No? continue to step 9.<br>
9. seach code for errors<br>
10. fix the errors(step 5 and 6)<br>
11. go back to step 8<br>
if you don't do that: you got no rights to call yourself a programmer and you should be ashamed.<br>
if you do follow that example and every office will love you<br>
fail to do so and someone will get pissed<br>
